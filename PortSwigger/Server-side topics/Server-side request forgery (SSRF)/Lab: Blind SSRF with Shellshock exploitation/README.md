# Lab: Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation

This repository contains a Java-based extension for Burp Suite using the burp.api.montoya API. The extension is designed to solve a specific lab involving blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Burp Suite Professional
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ma4747gh/PenetrationTestingScripts
cd PenetrationTestingScripts
```

### 2. Download the Montoya API

Download the Montoya API source code from the following link: [Montoya API](https://github.com/PortSwigger/burp-extensions-montoya-api)

Extract the contents and place the `burp` directory inside the root directory of this repository as shown below:

```
Lab: Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation
├── build
├── burp
│   └── api
│       └── montoya
│           └── ... (other Montoya API files)
├── labSolver
│   └── ... (other Java files)
└── README.md
```

### 3. Update Lab URL

Before compiling the Java files, you need to update the lab URL in two places:

1. Open `LabSolver.java` and replace the URL at line `40` with your specific lab URL.

### 4. Compile the Java Files

Run the following commands to compile the Java files and create the JAR file:

```sh
javac -d build/ labSolver/*.java
jar cvf 'Lab: Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation.jar' -C build/ .
```

### 5. Load the Extension in Burp Suite

1. Open Burp Suite Professional.
2. Go to the `Extensions` tab.
3. Click on the `Add` button.
4. Select the JAR file `Lab: Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation.jar`.
5. The extension should now be loaded and running.

### 6. Solve the Lab

With the extension loaded in Burp Suite, the extension will handle the interaction and solve the lab automatically without any further action required from you.
## Notes

- Ensure that you have replaced the lab URLs correctly before compiling the code.
